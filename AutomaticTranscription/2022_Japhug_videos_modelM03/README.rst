# Automatic transcription of videos in the Japhug language
These videos were transcribed using the best available acoustic model to date for Japhug (model M03). There is one file for each video file. The number ("2014...") is the name given by the depositor (Guillaume Jacques) to the videos.

The technology is HuggingFace Transformers - wav2vec2. The workflow is described `here <https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-03647315>`_.
